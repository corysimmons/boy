  A very opinionated, lightweight, version of HTML5 Boilerplate with conditionally-loaded polyfills and an opinionated CSS reset for firing up web projects in no time.

Boy comes with a handy project launcher so you can spin up a Boy boilerplate with all the relevant files pulled freshly from this repo:

```fish
$ # npm i -g boy <-- THIS NO LONGER WORKS. I GAVE THIS NPM PACKAGE NAME TO SOMEONE ELSE
$ boy foo
```

### Features
- A lightweight/2-space batch of [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com) features
  - [index.html](index.html) (with all the fluff removed)
  - [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) (modified to 2 spaces)
  - [.htaccess](.htaccess)
  - Harsher outdated browser warning (warns on IE9 instead of IE8)
- Minified and sourcemapped :rage3: [reeeset](https://github.com/corysimmons/reeeset) (opinionated [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css) for the real world)
- Polyfills for IE8 and below a la :heart: [ie-love](https://github.com/corysimmons/ie-love)

  - [calc-polyfill](https://github.com/closingtag/calc-polyfill)

### Where's Modernizr?
Modernizr isn't included by default for a few reasons.

1. I very rarely actually use Modernizr.
2. You should create your own custom build of Modernizr and put it at the bottom of the document if possible. Read Paul Irish's [comment on it](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/878#issuecomment-41448059).
3. `@supports` is going to be here soon.
